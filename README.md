# JavaScript Basics Repository  

This repository is a collection of JavaScript examples that cover the fundamental concepts of the language. It is intended for my personal use.

## ðŸš€ What's Included?  

- **Variables**: Demonstrating how to declare and use `var`, `let`, and `const`.  
- **Conditions**: Exploring `if`, `else`, `else if`, and `switch` statements.  
- **Loops**: Examples of `for`, `while`, and `do...while` loops, along with practical use cases.  
- **Functions**: Understanding function declarations, expressions, arrow functions, and parameter handling.
- **Arrays**: Collections of items (e.g., numbers, strings, objects) with methods like `push()`, `pop()`, `map()`, and `filter()` etc for manipulating data.
- **Objects**: Key-value pair structures that represent entities, supporting properties, methods, and destructuring for cleaner code.
- **DOM**: The Document Object Model that represents HTML documents, enabling element selection and dynamic manipulation via JavaScript.
- **Asynchronous Programming**: Techniques (callbacks, setTimeout, setInterval) to handle operations like timers without blocking the main thread.
- **Closures**: Functions that capture variables from their outer scope, allowing for data privacy and function factories.
- **Error Handling**: Using `try/catch/finally` and `throw` to manage and recover from runtime errors gracefully.
- **Promises**: Objects representing future completion or failure of an asynchronous operation, with methods like `.then()`, `.catch()`, and `.finally()`.
- **Async/Await**: Syntactic sugar over Promises enabling asynchronous code to be written in a synchronous style, often paired with `try/catch` for error handling.

## âœ¨ Why I Created This Repo  

This repository serves as:  
- A personal space to document and track my JavaScript journey.  
- A reference for revising basic and intermediate concepts.  
- A portfolio of my understanding of JavaScript fundamentals.

## ðŸ“Œ Future Plans  

- Add examples for advanced topics such as arrays, objects, and ES6+ features.  
- Include real-world mini-projects to apply these concepts.  
- Regularly update the repository as I learn new topics.
